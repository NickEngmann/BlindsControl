# Grove Button / Touch Sensor Demo

This simple demo controls a Grove LED from both a Grove Button and a web
application.

It doubles as a Grove Touch Sensor demo. To use with the touch sensor, simply
swap one in for the button. 

It also doubles as a Grove Relay demo. Just swap the LED module with a Relay
module.
