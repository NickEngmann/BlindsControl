# Grove Demos

The Seeed Studio Grove system makes experimenting and prototyping electronics
easy by taking a building block approach. The system consists of a base shield
and a wide variety of modules with standardized connectors.

The base shield lets you easily connect an Esquilo to all sorts of modules using
Grove cables. Each Grove module addresses a single function, such as a simple
button or a more complex heart rate sensor. Each module comes with clear
documentation and demo code to allow for quick and easy setup.

This is a collection of demos made specifically for Grove modules and the
Esquilo Air.

To get started with the demos, copy the contents of this repository to an
Esquilo's SD card *lib* directory and browse to the following page.
